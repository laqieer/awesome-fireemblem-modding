## Note
- Fire Emblem modding has a long history and many resources has become outdated as time flies. I only list resources which I think still useful here. Some obsolete resources are not included. Recommended resources are marked.
- All resources listed here are related to Fire Emblem modding specifically. Common resources for game hacking, programming, gba dev or reverse engineering are not included. They should have their own awesome repository.
- Resources listed here are for generic Fire Emblem modding. Too detailed or specialized resources are not included. I think it is better to google it when you need than list them all.
